Stock Data Visualization and Prediction
Welcome to the Stock Data Visualization and Prediction project! This application utilizes Python, Docker, Elasticsearch, Apache Kafka, and Kibana to visualize stock data and employs a linear regression model to predict stock trends. The project demonstrates a complete data pipeline, from data ingestion to visualization and prediction.

Project Overview
In this project, we created an application to visualize stock data and predict future trends using a linear regression model. The application is designed to handle large datasets and provides real-time data visualization through a web interface. By leveraging modern big data technologies, we ensure scalability, reliability, and performance.

Features
Real-time data ingestion: Fetch stock data and stream it using Apache Kafka.
Data storage and search: Store and index data using Elasticsearch.
Data visualization: Visualize stock data using Kibana.
Predictive modeling: Train and deploy a linear regression model to predict stock trends.
Containerized environment: Use Docker to containerize the application for easy deployment and scalability.
Architecture
The architecture of the application is composed of several components working together:

Data Ingestion: A Python script fetches stock data from a reliable API and sends it to Kafka.
Message Broker: Apache Kafka acts as the message broker, ensuring reliable and scalable data streaming.
Data Storage: Data from Kafka is consumed and stored in Elasticsearch.
Visualization: Kibana is used to create interactive and real-time visualizations of the stock data stored in Elasticsearch.
Prediction: A linear regression model is trained on historical stock data to predict future trends. The model is implemented in Python and can be updated periodically.
Technologies Used
Python: For data ingestion, processing, and machine learning model.
Docker: To containerize the application, ensuring consistency across different environments.
Elasticsearch: For storing and indexing stock data, enabling efficient search and retrieval.
Apache Kafka: For real-time data streaming and handling high-throughput data ingestion.
Kibana: For visualizing the stock data in an interactive and real-time manner.
Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

Clone the repository:

bash
Code kopieren
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-data-visualization-and-prediction.git
cd stock-data-visualization-and-prediction
Build and start Docker containers:
Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. Then, run:

bash
Code kopieren
docker-compose up --build
Set up the Python environment:
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

bash
Code kopieren
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the data ingestion script:

bash
Code kopieren
python ingest_data.py
Access Kibana:
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5601 to start visualizing the data.

Usage
Data Ingestion
Run the data ingestion script to start fetching and streaming stock data:

bash
Code kopieren
python ingest_data.py
Training the Model
To train the linear regression model, run the following script:

bash
Code kopieren
python train_model.py
Making Predictions
Use the trained model to make predictions:

bash
Code kopieren
python predict.py
Visualization
Use Kibana to create and customize visualizations for the stock data. Access Kibana at http://localhost:5601.
